    '''Hdaps accelerometer sensor machinery
    
    The x-axis is in the plane of the keyboard and points to the right 
    (from the perspective of a user sitting at the computer).
    
    The y-axis in in the plane of the keyboard and points towards the 
    back of the computer. 
    
    Rotation about the x-axis is Pitch and rotation about the y-axis 
    is Roll. The Thinkpad coordinate system differs from the the 
    aeronautical standard where the x-axis points "forward" and the 
    y-axis "out the right wing", so the relationship to pitch and 
    roll is different as well.
    
    Pitch, or rotation about the x-axis: As the screen of the Thinkpad 
    is tilted towards the user the "x" readings from the sensor 
    increase to a maximum when the keyboard is vertical with the space 
    bar being the lowest key. The "x" readings reach a minimum value 
    when the keyboard is vertical with the Esc key being the lowest 
    key. It appears that the "x" readings are proportional to the sine 
    of the angle of rotation about the x-axis.
    Place your right hand on to the keyboard and turn it over so the 
    palm faces up. Your thumb points to the right and in the direction 
    of the x-axis. If you curl your fingers towards you (making a 
    fist), your fingers are moving in the direction of positive 
    x-rotation angles.
    
    Roll, or rotation about the y-axis: As the left side of the 
    keyboard is lifted upwards, rotating the keyboard in a clockwise 
    direction, the "y" readings from the sensor increase to a maximum 
    value when the Thinkpad is on its right side (the Enter key is the 
    lowest key). It appears that the "y" readings are proportional to 
    the sine of the angle of rotation about the y-axis.
    
    Data indicates that the "x" readings can be converted to angles 
    (pitch) as: PITCH = ASIN(A_x / g) assuming that g is gravity and 
    the x readings A_x have been normalized such that they vary from 
    -1g to 1g. For y this would be: ROLL = ASIN(A_y / g)
    Once we have calibrated the readings by establishing the value when 
    flat and the maximum value, we can convert to angles (in degrees) 
    as follows (the example is for x, for y it is the analogous):

    x_normalized = ( x - avg_x_when_flat ) / ( max_x - avg_x_when_flat )
    radians_x = arcsine ( x_normalized )
    degrees_x = radians_x * 180 / PI

    Note that in my case the maximum and minimum readings were not 
    symmetrically positioned about the average "flat" reading. 
    I found that the readings for x range from +150 to -156 and for y 
    they range between +152 to -155. There is a good chance my work 
    surface is not horizontal.
    
    In order to achieve a good calibration read position data with 
    sampling interval of 150ms and log the output to this text file 
    while slowly rotating the computer through all pitch and roll 
    angles, moving slowly through the expected extremes. Then import 
    this data into a spreadsheet and compute the maximum and minimum 
    x and y values. With the assumption that the sensor's 
    sensitivity and accuracy are symmetrical about the zero position, 
    you should arrive at similar sensor range calibration for your 
    device:

    rest position    resolution
      x: 494.5       +/- 159.5
      y: 566.0       +/- 157.0
