Installation
============

The easiest way to install |project| on Ubuntu or Arch Linux is with your
package manager, as described in :ref:`installation-from-package`. If you are
on another distribution, then you can build and install it manually using the
instructions in :ref:`installation-build-manually`.

.. _installation-from-package:

From Package
------------

On Ubuntu and its derivatives, you can install from `Martin's PPA`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo -s
    # add-apt-repository ppa:martin-ueding/stable
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install thinkpad-scripts

On Arch Linux, you can install the ``thinkpad-scripts`` package from the AUR_.

.. _Martin's PPA: https://launchpad.net/~martin-ueding/+archive/stable
.. _AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/thinkpad-scripts

.. _installation-build-manually:

Build Manually
--------------

First install all the dependencies, listed in :ref:`installation-dependencies`.
Then, you can build and install with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make
    # make install

To make the ACPI hooks take effect, you will need to restart ``acpid`` with the
following on SysVinit/Upstart systems:

.. code-block:: console

    # service acpid restart

or on systemd systems:

.. code-block:: console

    # systemctl restart acpid

Packagers will also need to add the following line, run as root, to their post
installation hook to update the udev hardware database with the information in
``90-X2x0T-keyboard.hwdb``:

.. code-block:: console

    # udevadm hwdb --update

.. _installation-dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

These dependencies refer to Debian and Arch Linux packages, but should have
similar names in other distributions. ``yum`` in Fedora and ``zypper`` in
openSUSE have a search for “provides”. In openSUSE, you could use the ``cnf``
tool to find out the package.

.. [1]

    The Ubuntu Kernel with version ``3.11.0-17`` has a patched
    ``thinkpad-acpi`` module which allows it to control the LED in the
    microphone mute button. Previous versions of |project| would flash the
    power LED to signal a muted microphone. This branch of |project| does not
    flash the power LED anymore, therefore requiring that version of the
    kernel.

    openSUSE and other distributions are not patching the 3.?.0 kernel, but
    ship a 3.?.? kernel. So users of distributions other than Ubuntu (maybe
    even Debian) would have to check whether their kernel has the acpi patch.

Optional

These programs enhance the functionality of the scripts, but are not strictly
required.

Setup
=====

|project| includes files that hook into various hardware events:

* a udeb hwdb file that allows proper operation of the bezel buttons on ThinkPad
  X220 and X230 Tablet computers

* udev rules to automatically run thinkpad-dock when docking and undocking

* ACPI hooks to automatically call thinkpad-rotate when the screen is
  rotated/unrotated

All of these files should be installed as part of the installation process. If
acpid is not enabled by default on your computer (which is the case for Arch
Linux), you need to enable and start it for the ACPI hooks to work.
Additionally, after installing |project|, you may need to restart udev and
acpid for the new rules and hooks to take effect.

Usage
=====

After following the configuration instructions above, you generally will not
need to call any of the scripts manually. However, in case you do, this is a
synopsis of each command::

    thinkpad-dock [on|off]
    thinkpad-mutemic
    thinkpad-rotate [direction]
    thinkpad-touch [on|off]
    thinkpad-touchpad

See the :doc:`../man/index` for more details.

Configuration
=============

You can modify the default configuration for things such as the screen
brightness to set when docking, the relative positions of displays, and the
direction of screen rotation by placing configuration scripts in
``$HOME/.config/thinkpad-scripts``. See the :doc:`../man/index` for
more details.

You can also add scripts that will be called before/after docking or rotating
the display. See the man pages for :doc:`../man/thinkpad-dock.1` and
:doc:`../man/thinkpad-rotate.1` for more details.

Tips
====

|project| fixes the bezel buttons so that they work, but it does not bind
anything to them by default. If you'd like, you can bind the ``thinkpad-rotate``
script (or any other program for that matter) to one of the bezel buttons using
your desktop environment. For example, under GNOME, go to “Settings” →
“Keyboard” → “Shortcuts” → “Custom Shortcuts” and add a new “shortcut”.

|project| includes a script, ``thinkpad-touch``, to make it easy to toggle the
touchscreen of the X220 Tablet on/off. If you want to disable your touch screen
on startup, use your desktop environment to call ``thinkpad-touch off`` when
starting.

Under KDE, it is convenient to place all of the scripts in a drawer so that you
can access them quickly. See :doc:`kde-script-drawer` for instructions to do
this.
