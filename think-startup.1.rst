SYNOPSIS
========

::

    think-startup

DESCRIPTION
===========

This program runs various commands on system startup. It allows the user to
disable the touch screen at that time (depending on the value of
``disable_touch``).

There will be a script installed in ``/etc/X11/Xsession.d/`` that will
automatically run ``think-startup`` as the user logged in on the primary screen
when X starts.

EXIT STATUS
===========

0
    Everything okay.
1
    Some error.

FILES
=====

You can create a config file in ``$HOME/.config/think-rotate/startup.sh``, which
is a simple Bash script that is going to be sourced from ``think-startup``.

A sample config would look like this::

    disable_touch=true

You can set the following option:

``disable_touch``
    Whether to enable/disable the touch screen. Set it to ``true`` or something
    else.

EXAMPLE
=======

You can just call ``think-startup``.
