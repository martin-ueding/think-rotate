ThinkPad Rotate
###############

Website
=======

Motivation for this project is on the `project website
<http://martin-ueding.de/en/projects/think-rotate#pk_campaign=git>`_.

Installation
============

From Package
------------

On Ubuntu and its derivatives, you can install from `Martin's PPA`_::

    $ sudo -s
    # add-apt-repository ppa:martin-ueding/stable
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install think-rotate

On Arch Linux, you can install the ``think-rotate`` package from the AUR_
(coming soon).

.. _Martin's PPA: https://launchpad.net/~martin-ueding/+archive/stable
.. _AUR: http://aur.archlinux.org

Build Manually
--------------

First install all the dependencies, listed in the following section.  Then, you
can build and install with::

    $ make
    # make install

If you set a ``DESTDIR``, you will also need to run::

    # service acpid restart

Dependencies
============

These dependencies refer to Debian and Arch Linux packages, but should have
similar names in other distributions. ``yum`` in Fedora and ``zypper`` in
openSUSE have a search for “provides”. In openSUSE, you could use the ``cnf``
tool to find out the package.

Build
-----

These programs are needed during the build process.

Optional
~~~~~~~~

These programs enhance the functionality of the scripts, but are not strictly
required.

=========================== ============== ================ ==================
For                         Needed Program Debian package   Arch Linux package
=========================== ============== ================ ==================
volume control when docking pactl          pulseaudio-utils libpulse

=========================== ============== ================ ==================

Note: To use ``qdbus`` on Arch Linux, you should also install
``qtchooser`` and configure it to use Qt 4 (see the ArchWiki_) or
patch ``lib/kdialog.sh`` to call ``qdbus-qt4`` instead of ``qdbus``.
A patch is available as part of the AUR package (coming soon).
