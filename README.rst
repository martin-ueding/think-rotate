Website
=======

Motivation for this project is on the `project website
<http://martin-ueding.de/en/projects/think-rotate#pk_campaign=git>`_.

Installation
============

From Package
------------

On Ubuntu and its derivatives, you can install from `Martin's PPA`_::

    $ sudo -s
    # add-apt-repository ppa:martin-ueding/stable
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install think-rotate

On Arch Linux, you can install the ``think-rotate`` package from the AUR_.

.. _Martin's PPA: https://launchpad.net/~martin-ueding/+archive/stable
.. _AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/think-rotate

Build Manually
--------------

First install all the dependencies, listed in the following section.  Then, you
can build and install with::

    $ make
    # make install

To make the ACPI hooks take effect, you will need to restart ``acpid`` with the
following on SysVinit/Upstart systems::

    # service acpid restart

or on systemd systems::

    # systemctl restart acpid

Packagers will also need to add the following line, run as root, to their post
installation hook to update the udev hardware database with the information in
``90-X2x0T-keyboard.hwdb``::

    udevadm hwdb --update

Dependencies
============

These dependencies refer to Debian and Arch Linux packages, but should have
similar names in other distributions. ``yum`` in Fedora and ``zypper`` in
openSUSE have a search for “provides”. In openSUSE, you could use the ``cnf``
tool to find out the package.

We document the usage and configuration of the programs in their manual pages.
If you have the software installed, you can just use ``man <program-name>`` to
read the man page corresponding to ``<program-name>``.
