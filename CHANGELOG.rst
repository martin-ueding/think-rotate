Changelog

v4.7.4
    Released: 2016-07-13 10:35:07 +0200

    - Update the name of the Wacom touch screen such that its name also works
      on Fedora 23 (GH-120).

v4.7.3
    Released: 2016-04-15 13:14:40 +0200

    - Fix location of ``sphinx-build`` on Fedora (GH-119). Contributed by
      Aruee.

v4.7.2
    Released: 2016-04-14 21:07:41 +0200

    - Ubuntu seems to ship with a version of XRandR which set the ``Wacom
      Rotation`` property of a few devices, but not all of them. As we have
      switched to the rotation matrix some versions ago, we and XRandR
      interfere with each other. Now we reset the rotation made by XRandR. Jim
      tested this on Ubuntu 15.10, so that should fix GH-117 and GH-112.

    - Debug shell commands are pretty-printed using ``shlex.quote``. That way,
      one can directly paste the log output into a shell and re-run a given
      command.

v4.7.1
    Released: 2015-10-20 17:14:26 +0200

    - Fix errors caused by hooks at boot time. Hooks are sometimes executed at
      boot when no user is logged in yet. This would cause error logs that are
      just annoying for the user as he/she is greeted with crash reports. This
      fixes GH-110 and GH-111.

v4.7.0
    Released: 2015-10-16 10:10:16 +0200

    - Add configuration option to disable the rotate and dock hook
      individually.
    - In cases where ``/dev/log`` does not exist, it will use standard UDP to
      connect to the log.

v4.6.0
    Released: 2015-10-15 20:30:31 +0200

    - Add a ``--force-direction`` command line option for ``thinkpad-rotate``
      such that this can be used in a script. When starting up the computer an
      autostart entry like ::

          thinkpad-rotate --force-direction normal

      could be very handy to normalize the setup.

v4.5.0
    Released: 2015-10-15 16:50:57 +0200

    - Add ``chvt`` workaround as suggested by Cody Christensen.

v4.4.2
    Released: 2015-07-31 15:14:59 +0200

    - Fix error in docking. I have broken it by assigning a temporary to a
      variable ``output`` which also happened to be the function argument.
      Sorry. I wish I had ``const`` in Python :-/.

v4.4.1
    Released: 2015-07-29 08:23:28 +0200

    - Check list of PulseAudio devices to get sound settings right.
      (Contributed by Jannis Stoppe, thank you!)
    - Update regular expressions for ``xinput``. We have been using the ones
      for ``xsetwacom`` until now. Since we have switched to ``xinput`` in
      version 4.2.3, this should fix bugs since then.

v4.4.0
    Released: 2015-05-09 10:51:34 +0200

    - Add a workaround for an XRandr bug that I have on my machine.

v4.3.0
    Released: 2015-03-25 14:53:31 +0100

    - Fix a bug that was introduced in 69ef6ea. This leads to premature exit
      and dump of a stacktrace. The screens got rotated, but the TrackPoint
      would not be disabled.

    - Add an option to disable the internal screen on docking (GH-103).

v4.2.6
    Released: 2015-03-15 22:53:34 +0100

    - Update documentation for openSUSE package

v4.2.5
    Released: 2015-03-15 19:28:52 +0100

    - Remove icons from docking desktop files to get it to build on openSUSE
      Build Service

v4.2.4
    Released: 2015-02-19 18:49:21 +0100

    - Write transformation matrices to debug output.
    - Small fixes in documentation: Remove dead navigation entry and use
      correct syntax highlighting for config snippet.

v4.2.3
    Released: 2015-02-08

    - Add documentation about Fedora package
    - Add hardware specific documentation
    - Replace ``xsetwacom`` with ``xinput`` in all cases and use transformation
      matrix (GH-91)
    - Add a nice error message when a screen could not be found
    - Remove ``termcolor`` as a dependency
    - Always have at least one screen enabled
    - Be more careful with ``gsettings``, check whether the schema exists
      before writing to it

v4.2.2
    Released: 2015-01-24

    - Remove dependency on ``termcolor`` since that is not packaged for Python
      3 in Ubuntu or Fedora. It was not needed heavily anyway, so I just got
      rid of it.

    - Add manual page for ``thinkpad-config``
    - Add manual page for ``thinkpad-trackpoint``
    - Add manual page for ``thinkpad-scripts-config-migration``
    - Add a common epilogue for all manual pages

    - Remove mailing list from README
    - Replace hard coded strings with configuration options (GH-91)
    - Toggle touch screen with ``xinput`` only (GH-91)
    - Give a real error when rotation cannot be determined (GH-92)

v4.2.1
    Released: 2015-01-20

    - Fix errors in ``.desktop`` files
    - Use built-in mocking for unit tests

v4.2.0
    Released: 2015-01-15

    - Log error when unsupported key is given to rotate hook.
    - Fix ``full-install`` target in makefile.
    - Add ``test`` target to makefile.
    - Add support for multiple external monitors. See the manual page of
      ``thinkpad-dock`` for the details of the configuration options.

v4.1.5
    Released: 2014-10-26

    - Make selection of ethernet connection which is restarted predictable.
    - Remove call to ``nmcli con down`` in the restarting of the network
      connection. This makes it compatible with nmcli 0.9.10. That closes
      `GH-81 <https://github.com/martin-ueding/thinkpad-scripts/issues/81>`_,
      fixes `GH-74
      <https://github.com/martin-ueding/thinkpad-scripts/issues/74>`_ and closes
      `GH-75 <https://github.com/martin-ueding/thinkpad-scripts/issues/75>`_,

v4.1.4
    Released: 2014-10-25

    - Fix `GH-79
      <https://github.com/martin-ueding/thinkpad-scripts/issues/79>`_ by
      catching the exceptions and logging warnings. Missing TrackPoint and
      TouchPad do not cause the program to abort now.

v4.1.3
    Released: 2014-10-15

    - Fix breakage of the rotation script when the subpixel order cannot be
      changed for some reason. An error is logged then.

v4.1.2
    Released: 2014-10-05

    - Fix hiding of Unity launcher (GitHub #72)
    - Warn about ``make install`` (GitHub #76)

v4.1.1
    Released: 2014-09-07

    - Add ``network.connection_name`` configuration option.
    - Add support for ``nmcli`` v0.9.10 command line interface.

v4.1
    Released: 2014-07-12

    - Add ``tablet-normal`` rotation. That will not rotate the screen but
      deactivate the trackpoint.
    - Accept all rotation names again.

v4.0.8:
    Released: 2014-06-14

    - Fix some errors in the manual pages

v4.0.7
    Released: 2014-06-14

    - Make triggering on hardware rotation slightly more robust against changes
      in the event that ``acpid`` gives.

v4.0.6
    Released: 2014-06-02

    - Toggle Wacom Touch property with ``xsetwacom`` as well as using
      ``xinput``.

v4.0.5
    Released: 2014-05-29

    - Automatic determination of ethernet network connection
    - ``make install`` does not restart any services. ``make full-install``
      does that now.

v4.0.4
    Released: 2014-05-29

    - State Python termcolor dependency in the documentation
    - Stop failing if ``gsettings`` is not installed
    - Add subpixel rotation in Xfce
    - Warn about missing screen when docking

v4.0.3
    Released: 2014-05-28

    - Replace unicode arrow because of Launchpad errors.

v4.0.2
    Released: 2014-05-28

    - Assert Python 3 everywhere. I suspect that the Launchpad Build System
      uses Python 2 for some reason. That causes some unicode errors.

v4.0.1
    Released: 2014-05-28

    - Fill in dependencies in the “Getting Started“ guide.
    - Explicitly state the encoding in ``getversion.py``.

v4.0
    Released: 2014-05-27

    - Complete rewrite in Python 3.
    - INI style config. Run ``thinkpad-scripts-config-migrate`` to help you
      migrate your config.
    - Remove the transitional scripts. If you have anything that still depends
      on having scripts starting with ``think-``, **this will break!**
    - v3.0.1 introduced more relative positions by putting the ``-of`` into
      your configuration variable. Old configurations that still had ``left``
      or ``right`` still worked, since the script appended the ``-of`` for you.
      Those couple lines were removed, so **add a ``-of`` to your config, if
      you do not have already!**

    - You can change the regular expression that matches the Wacom devices now
      in the config. That is ``touch.regex`` in the config.

v3.5.1
    Released: 2014-02-22

    - Small fixes in the manual pages

v3.5
    Released: 2014-02-22

    - **Added**: Set the option ``toggle_unity_launcher`` for
      :doc:`/man/thinkpad-rotate.1` to un-hide the Unity launcher whenever the
      screen is rotated. This was previously an example hook in the guides, now
      it is part of the main suite of scripts.

v3.4
    Released: 2014-02-21

    - Rename all the scripts from ``think-`` to ``thinkpad-`` to match the new
      project name. To ease transition, there are transition scripts with the
      old names. **Be sure to adjust all your scripts and hooks accordingly!**
      The transition scripts will be dropped with version 4.0.
    - Rename the configuration directory from ``~/.config/think-rotate`` to
      ``~/.config/thinkpad-scripts``. There is an automatic upgrade script in
      place, so calling either ``thinkpad-rotate`` or ``thinkpad-dock`` will
      rename your configuration folder if it exists and there is no new one
      already existing.
    - Put dates into the changelog, for all releases so far.

v3.3
    Released: 2014-02-21

    - Rename project to “thinkpad-scripts”
    - Add subpixel anti-alias order change on rotation for Gnome

v3.2
    Released: 2014-01-07

    - Update copyright years in the documentation.
    - Add a guard that prevents multiple execution of ``think-dock`` and
      ``think-rotate``. For some reason, the ``udev`` hooks call the script
      twice, resulting in race conditions.

v3.1.2
    Released: 2014-01-07

    - Fix finding of external display. I tried to improve the syntax, but let
      the script fail whenever the number needed to be incremented.

v3.1.1
    Released: 2014-01-05

    - Clean all ``*.pyc`` files in makefile. This was causing errors with
      prisine tars and Debian packaging before.
    - Add changelog to documentation

v3.1
    Released: 2014-01-03

    - Pass target orientation to postrotate hook
    - Pass version number to Sphinx automatically from the changelog

v3.0.2
    Released: 2013-12-19

    - Manual pages with Sphinx

v3.0.1
    Released: 2013-12-10

    - Allow more relative positions by putting the ``-of`` into the value of
      the ``relative_position`` variable

v3.0
    Released: 2013-12-01

    - Settings of the keycodes is now done via a ``.hwdb`` file for ``udev``.
      This requires ``udev`` to be of version 196 or greater. Therefore, it is
      marked as a major release, since it breaks Ubuntu 13.04 and earlier.

v2.11
    Released: 2013-12-01

    - Add some guides: “Additional Keys” and “KDE Script Drawer”
    - Fix recursive make, pass ``-j`` down to child processes

v2.10.2
    Released: 2013-10-30

    - Actually return from function.

v2.10.1
    Released: 2013-10-28

    - Do not fail if ``qdbus`` does not work (like on vanilla Kubuntu 13.10)

v2.10
    Released: 2013-10-28

    - Print missing programs
    - Do not fail if ``qdbus`` is missing

v2.9
    Released: 2013-10-07

    - **Added**: ACPI hook to call ``think-rotate`` (Jim Turner)
    - **Added**: Support for systemd network inferface names (Jim Turner)
    - **Removed**: ``think-resume`` (Jim Turner)
    - Use syslog in ``think-dock``
    - Update documentation
    - State all dependencies (Debian package names)
    - Change indentation to four spaces instead of a single tab

v2.8.1
    Released: 2013-09-30

    - More logging to syslog
    - Disable ``kdialog`` for ACPI hooks since that does now work well

v2.8
    Released: 2013-09-24

    - Translate to German

v2.7.1
    Released: 2013-08-08

    - Close KDialog progress bar when the script fails (via ``trap``)

v2.7
    Released: 2013-07-31

    - **Added**: Hooks
    - **Added**: ``on|off`` for the ``think-touchpad`` script

v2.6
    Released: 2013-06-26

    - Support for ``kdialog`` status.

v2.5.2
    Released: 2013-05-10

    - Update the ACPI hooks to find other docks as well

v2.5.1
    Released: 2013-05-06

    - Find other docks as well

v2.5
    Released: 2013-02-03

    - Get microphone mute button to work

v2.4.1
    Released: 2012-12-29

    - Actually install makefiles
    - Implement required actions in ``init.d`` script to that Debian lintian
      does not complain

v2.4
    Released: 2012-12-29

    - Fix bezel keyboard codes, so that they are usable. (Jim Turner)
    - Add script to toggle touch screen. (Jim Turner)
    - Organize code in subdirectories, using recursive make.

v2.3.1
    Released: 2012-11-02

    - Map Wacom devices to the output when rotating in any case. Thanks to Jim
      Turner!

v2.3
    Released: 2012-10-25

    - Add support for other virtual keyboards. Thanks to Jim Turner!
    - Use shorter redirection (``&>`` instead of ``2>&!``).

v2.2.1
    Released: 2012-10-22

    - Fix spelling typo in ``relative_position``. Thanks to Jim Turner!

v2.2
    Released: 2012-10-15

    - Background most tasks so that they run in parallel. This should speed up
      docking.

v2.1
    Released: 2012-10-06

    - Only set Wacom screen devices. That way, any attached Wacom graphics
      tablet is not affected by the docking.

v2.0
    Released: 2012-08-31

    - Use the kernel to determine what the docking status is.
    - Add ``udev`` rules to perform the docking action.

v1.5
    Released: 2012-08-31

    - Desktop files for think-dock.

v1.4.5
    Released: 2012-07-21

    - Revert too intelligent behavior.

v1.4.4
    Released: 2012-07-21

    - Even if the user calls ``think-dock on``, do not dock if there is no
      external monitor attached. This might be the case when the ``think-dock
      on`` is called automatically without any prior checks. If the script
      would dock either way, it might disable wireless (although that is only
      done when ``eth0`` is connected) and set the volume to a wrong setting.

v1.4.3
    Released: 2012-07-20

    - Disable the wireless connection on docking.

v1.4.2
    Released: 2012-07-20

    - Fix commands in ``.desktop`` files.

v1.4.1
    Released: 2012-07-20

    - Install ``.desktop`` files.

v1.4
    Released: 2012-07-20

    - Query the state of the whole system automatically and determine the right
      action. You can still specify ``on`` or ``off``, if you want to.

v1.3
    Released: 2012-07-16

    - Optional config file for ``think-dock``.

v1.2.2
    Released: 2012-07-16

    - Fix flip direction.

v1.2.1
    Released: 2012-07-16

    - Disable wireless only when eth0 connected.
    - Document options.

v1.2
    Released: 2012-07-15

    - Change display brightness on docking.

v1.1
    Released: 2012-07-15

    - Check whether programs are there before using them.
    - Create directories on ``make install``.
    - Disable wifi when going onto the docking station.
    - Enable sound on docking.
    - Lower the volume after docking.
    - Query Wacom devices automatically.

v1.0
    Released: 2012-07-13

    This is the first release with a version number. It contains a couple fixes
    and improvements compared to previous (before 2012-07-13) versions of these
    scripts.

    - Accept other names for the rotation.
    - Disable the trackpad as well.
    - Start and stop the virtual keyboard.
    - Try to go back automatically, if a rotation is already set.
    - Use ``--rotation`` instead of ``-o``. This will only rotate the internal
      screen and not any attached screens as well.

Way before 2012-07-13, those are significant changes in the history:

- Add desktop files.
- Also set Wacom hardware correctly.
- Determine resolution automatically.
- Disable trackpoint when switching.
- Dynamically find external display.
- Limit Wacom devices to internal screen.
- Set external monitor as primary.
